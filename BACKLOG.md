# Full Regalia League — Backlog

**Open this file first each session.** Full reasoning/architecture lives in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Status

- **Current phase:** Core feature-complete beta as of 2026-08-01. Live at
  **https://nelsonmartini.github.io/full-regalia-league/** (passphrase `regalia2026`).
  7 pages: Home, Standings, Picks, History, Player detail, Live, Betting Guide.
- **What's real vs. sample data right now:**
  - Standings: still sample/snapshot data from the workbook (not live-wired to the Sheet).
  - History + Player pages: real, full season data (344 picks, 23 weeks, 16 players) —
    but it's a frozen snapshot parsed from the workbook, not live either.
  - Picks page: **fully real** — live current games + live odds from ESPN, saves
    locally per-device.
  - Live page + Home's live-games card: **fully real**, refetches every 30s.
  - Auto-grading ("Your results" on Picks): **fully real, functioning engine** —
    just has nothing to show yet because no picked game has finished. It'll populate
    itself automatically as games conclude, no code changes needed.
- **Xavier University blue recolor: done** (2026-08-01). Official brand blue #0C2340
  confirmed via web search + Xavier's own brand PDF, used for card surfaces; brighter
  blue tint (#4a90d9) for buttons/badges/highlights. Icons regenerated to match.
- **Next action:** Publish the Google Sheet to the web (Neil to do — see below), then
  wire Standings/History to it so those two also go fully live.
- **Passphrase gate is live on every page** — needed before sharing the link publicly,
  since GitHub Pages has no other access control. Passphrase: `regalia2026`. Not real
  security, just stops casual stumbling — see `js/gate.js`.

## Next 7 days

1. **Neil to do:** Publish the Google Sheet to the web (File → Share → Publish to
   web → CSV, per tab) and send the CSV links — 2 minutes, only he can do it.
2. Wire Standings (and ideally History, replacing the frozen snapshot) to the live
   published CSV instead of static data.
3. **Player avatars** — clickable avatar next to each name (Standings, Picks
   player-select, History) so it's obviously "you" at a glance, and so a tap jumps
   straight to that person's results/money-won view. Asked 2026-08-01. Needs a
   decision: real photos (someone has to supply them) vs. generated avatars
   (initials-on-color, no photo needed — faster, no dependency on anyone). Leaning
   generated for a fast v1, real photos as an upgrade later.
4. Championship/Bowl Picks page (Divisional/Conf Champ/Super Bowl — same pattern as
   Picks, proven out now that Picks pulls real games).
5. Results page (a straight log of finished games + scores — mostly "for free" now
   since live-scores.js already fetches this; just needs its own page/view).
6. Real picks-submission backend (own project — needs a backend/auth decision so
   picks sync across the group instead of living in each person's browser). This is
   also what "money won" tracking on a player page needs — money/winnings live in
   the Sheet's Standings tab, not in anything wired up yet.

## Living checklist

- [x] Read `Full Regalia 2025 Pick'Em.xlsx` and map all 7 tabs to a site structure
- [x] Confirm architecture decisions with Neil (picks UI vs. full backend; data source)
- [x] Write `ROADMAP.md`
- [x] Write `BACKLOG.md`
- [x] Site shell: shared CSS design system, nav (bottom tab bar on mobile)
- [x] PWA manifest + icons + basic service worker (Add to Home Screen)
- [x] Betting Guide page (static content from the workbook, ported as-is; dropped one
      slightly off-tone line from the original to keep it welcoming for the whole group)
- [x] Standings page (sample data tonight, 15 players, sorted by points)
- [x] Home dashboard page
- [x] Picks-entry UI — real chip selectors per game (5 sample games), saves to browser
      local storage as a placeholder (no permanent backend yet)
- [x] Browser-tested locally (Playwright) — zero console errors across all 5 pages;
      found & fixed 2 bugs (see session log below)
- [x] Test on an actual phone — Neil confirmed it "looks amazing on a phone" via LAN
- [x] Init local git repo
- [x] Create GitHub repo + enable Pages — live at
      https://nelsonmartini.github.io/full-regalia-league/
- [x] Passphrase gate for safe beta-sharing (`regalia2026`)
- [x] History page (season log, filterable by player/week) — 344 picks, 23 weeks
- [x] Player detail page (tap-a-name from Standings: summary stats, points trend,
      full week-by-week history)
- [x] Live scores via ESPN scoreboard API (NFL + college football, no key needed)
- [x] Live odds via ESPN (embedded in the same free response — turned out to make
      The Odds API unnecessary; NFL ~100% coverage, college ~50%)
- [x] Picks page rewired to real live games + real odds (was fake sample data)
- [x] **Auto-grading engine** (`js/grading.js`) — the core value prop. Unit-tested
      17/17. Wired into Picks page as a "Your results" card, auto-populates once a
      picked game goes final. Full pipeline (→ auto-updating Standings) still needs
      the picks backend + Sheet-wiring below to be fully end-to-end for the group.
- [x] Xavier University blue recolor — official #0C2340 confirmed, palette + icons updated
- [ ] Wire Standings/History to live Google Sheet CSV (still sample/frozen data)
- [ ] Player avatars (generated initials-on-color for v1) — clickable, next to names on
      Standings/Picks/History, tap-through to that player's results/money-won view
- [ ] Championship/Bowl Picks page
- [ ] Results page (dedicated view — data's already flowing via live-scores.js)
- [ ] Real picks-submission backend (own project — needs backend/auth decision)
- [ ] Real logo/wordmark (using text mark for now)

## Session log

### 2026-07-29
- Located and read `Full Regalia 2025 Pick'Em.xlsx` (7 tabs: Picks, Championship Picks,
  Game Lines, Results, Standings, History, Betting Guide). 15 players, mostly couples.
- Confirmed with Neil: (1) picks beta = real entry UI now, backend write-back is a
  placeholder; (2) keep the Google Sheet as the data source, published as CSV.
- Neil clarified the actual point of "backend automation" is eliminating the manual
  weekly grind of looking up scores and retyping them into the sheet by hand — auto-
  grading picks against live results is the headline feature, not just displaying the
  sheet online. Updated `ROADMAP.md` to reflect this as the top-priority feature once
  live scores are wired up.
- Wrote `ROADMAP.md` and this `BACKLOG.md`.
- Built the full site: shared design system (`css/style.css`), PWA manifest + generated
  app icons + service worker, and 5 pages (Home, Standings, Picks, Live stub, Betting
  Guide) with a shared bottom-tab nav.
- Browser-tested every page locally at mobile viewport with Playwright. Found and fixed
  2 bugs: (1) `picks.html` crashed on load with `titleCase is not defined` because that
  helper only lived in `standings-data.js`, which the Picks page never loaded — moved
  `titleCase()` into the shared `app.js` instead. (2) Bottom-nav active-tab highlighting
  only worked on Home, because the local dev server strips `.html` from URLs and the
  matching code didn't account for that — fixed to normalize both sides before
  comparing, so it works whether the host serves `/page.html` (GitHub Pages) or
  `/page` (clean URLs). Re-tested after fixes: both confirmed working, no regressions.
- Not done tonight: GitHub repo/Pages deploy (needs a quick confirm from Neil first —
  makes the code public), Google Sheet publish-to-web, live scores/odds, auto-grading
  pipeline, Championship Picks/Results/History pages, real picks backend.
- Neil tested the site live on his phone over the home WiFi (local server bound to
  0.0.0.0, shared via LAN IP) — confirmed "looks amazing on a phone." Add to Home
  Screen not yet tested (session paused before getting to it).
- Neil asked about the History tab — realized it wasn't built yet ("I don't really see
  much history here"). Proposed and he approved: a History page (season log) plus
  tap-a-name drill-down from Standings into a per-player history/stats page. Started
  re-extracting the full 346-row History sheet from the workbook (the first dump only
  got ~60 rows / Week 4 due to a row cap) — **paused mid-extraction, nothing built yet.**
  This is the next session's first task (see item 0 above).
- Repo creation is blocked on Neil (no gh CLI/token available here) — waiting on him
  to create the empty repo at github.com/new before anything gets pushed/deployed.

### 2026-07-31 / 2026-08-01
- Neil tested the site live on his phone via the LAN link — loved it.
- Quick wins added: Add-to-Home-Screen instructional card (Home page, iOS/Android
  aware), favicon + Open Graph/Twitter share-preview tags on all pages, service worker
  reliability fixes (cache shell files individually; network-first for page
  navigations — this fixed a real bug a Playwright test caught where cross-page nav
  broke once the SW activated on hosts that redirect .html to clean URLs).
- Neil wants to show the beta to a "future owner" (context: pitching the concept, not
  yet a full league rollout). Discussed safe-sharing options; he chose to keep real
  friend names as-is but add a lightweight passphrase gate. Built `js/gate.js` — a
  client-side SHA-256 passphrase check on every page, clearly documented as a
  courtesy speed bump, not real security (no server, so determined viewers can bypass
  it via dev tools). Current passphrase: `regalia2026`. Verified end-to-end with
  Playwright (wrong-passphrase error, correct unlock, persists via localStorage
  across pages).
- **GitHub repo created:** https://github.com/nelsonmartini/full-regalia-league —
  code committed and pushed to `main`. **GitHub Pages not yet enabled** — needs Neil
  to flip it on in repo Settings (can't be done from this environment, no GitHub
  token/gh CLI available). Once enabled, live URL is
  https://nelsonmartini.github.io/full-regalia-league/.
- Session ended here (Neil had to leave) — History page work is still not started,
  remains the first thing to build next session (see below, unchanged from before).

### Design request — not yet done
- Neil wants the site's color palette shifted toward **Xavier University blue**
  (their brand blue, not the current coral/amber accent) — asked 2026-08-01, not
  implemented yet. Need to confirm exact hex/reference (Xavier's brand blue is
  roughly #0C2340 navy + a brighter blue accent — verify against their actual brand
  guide rather than guessing) before reworking `css/style.css`'s `--accent`/`--bg`
  variables. Should stay in the same "friendly, fresh, couples-inclusive" direction,
  just recolored — not a full redesign.

### 2026-08-01 (afternoon session — "let's knock out the big stuff")
- Set up a Claude Code permissions allowlist (`C:\Users\neilm\.claude\settings.json`)
  so routine read-only commands stop prompting Neil for approval every time.
- **Built the History page and per-player drill-down** (the item paused at the end of
  the last session): re-extracted the workbook's History tab in full this time (344
  rows, no row cap), parsed it into `js/history-data.js`, built `history.html`
  (filterable season log) and `player.html` (tap-a-name from Standings → season
  summary, points-by-week trend bars, full week-by-week pick history). Nav grew from
  5 to 6 tabs. Standings rows are now links into the player page.
- Neil asked whether GitHub Pages was live yet mid-session — it was (confirmed 200,
  he must have flipped the Settings toggle himself). Verified end-to-end on production.
- Neil asked for the site's color scheme to move toward Xavier University blue —
  logged above as a design request, not implemented yet (needs exact brand hex first).
- **Researched ESPN's public scoreboard API** and confirmed two important things:
  (1) it's CORS-open (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), so it can be called directly
  from the browser with no proxy/backend needed; (2) it includes betting odds
  (spread/moneyline/over-under via DraftKings) embedded in the same free response —
  NFL coverage is ~100%, college is ~50% (smaller games often lack a posted line).
  This meant **The Odds API is no longer needed** — ESPN alone covers both scores
  and odds, simplifying the plan from ROADMAP.md.
- **Built live scores/odds** (`js/live-scores.js`): Live page now shows real games
  with an All/Live-now filter, auto-refreshing every 30s; Home page's live-games
  card shows the top 3. Verified against real data (confirmed real NFL preseason +
  college games rendering, not placeholders).
- **Built the auto-grading engine** (`js/grading.js`) — the headline feature Neil
  called out as the actual point of "automatic backend numbers": pure functions that
  grade a structured pick (spread/moneyline/total) against a finished game's score,
  returning hit/miss/push and points. Unit-tested directly in Node (17/17 passing)
  before trusting it, since this is the logic that matters most.
- **Rewired the Picks page** to pull real current games + real live odds instead of
  last session's fake sample matchups, and to store picks as structured objects
  (`{type, team, line}`) instead of display strings, so they're gradable. Added a
  "Your results" card that auto-grades a player's saved picks as soon as the
  underlying game goes final — verified it correctly stays hidden when nothing's
  graded yet (expected, since people can only pick pre-kickoff games) and that picks
  persist correctly across reloads.
- Every change this session was Playwright-tested locally before pushing; found and
  fixed bugs pre-emptively rather than shipping broken. Three commits pushed to
  `main`, all deployed and verified live.
- **Not done:** Standings/History still aren't wired to the live Google Sheet (still
  waiting on Neil to publish it to web); Xavier blue recolor; Championship Picks and
  Results pages; the real multi-user picks backend.

### Next session — resume here
- Check whether Neil has published the Google Sheet to web yet — if so, wire
  Standings (and ideally History) to the live CSV instead of the frozen snapshots.
- If Neil has a Xavier University brand guide/hex codes, do the color recolor next —
  it's a contained CSS-variable change (`css/style.css`), shouldn't need a rebuild of
  any page structure.
- After that: Championship/Bowl Picks page, then a dedicated Results page (the data's
  already flowing through `live-scores.js`, mostly a display/filtering job).
